# C-Bos Devtools
 This is a toolkit for people wanting to make mods or contribute to cbos.

 I expect only me to use this.

 In the test folder is files for testing out the addpackage subcommand

# Installation
 Make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed

 Then run `npm install cbos-devtools`

# Usage
 Go to the cbos directory and run `cbosdev addpackage [package you want to add]`

 That will install the package you specified then add it to C-Bos.py and requirements.txt
